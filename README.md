# Microbial Energy Economy Game

### Objective:

In the Microbial Energy Economy Game, students play as heterotrophs in a microbial ecosystem, evolving their organisms to maximize ATP production while managing available electron donors and acceptors.

### Scenario 1: Unlimited Oxygen

In this scenario, oxygen is abundant, and the main electron acceptor. The goal is to oxidize all available electron donors, such as glucose and cellulose, while evolving your heterotrophs to grow and maximize ATP production.

	•	Win Condition: Successfully oxidize all glucose and cellulose, while evolving heterotrophs for efficient ATP production.
	•	Lose Condition: All heterotrophs die due to insufficient ATP production.

### Scenario 2: Oxygen Limiting

In this scenario, oxygen is limited, forcing you to adapt and use alternative electron acceptors like nitrate, iron, and sulfur. As oxygen is depleted, you must evolve anaerobic capabilities to continue generating ATP.

	•	Win Condition: Successfully evolve your heterotrophs to survive anaerobically and oxidize all available glucose and cellulose, even as oxygen runs out.
	•	Lose Condition: All heterotrophs die due to insufficient ATP or failure to adapt to anaerobic conditions.
