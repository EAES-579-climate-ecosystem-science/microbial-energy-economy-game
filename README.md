# Microbial Energy Economy Game

### Objective:

In the Microbial Energy Economy Game, students play as heterotrophs in a microbial ecosystem, evolving their organisms to maximize ATP production while managing available electron donors and acceptors.

### Scenario 1: Unlimited Oxygen

In this scenario, oxygen is abundant, and the main electron acceptor. The goal is to oxidize all available electron donors, such as glucose and cellulose, while evolving your heterotrophs to grow and maximize ATP production.

	•	Win Condition: Successfully oxidize all glucose and cellulose, while evolving heterotrophs for efficient ATP production.
	•	Lose Condition: All heterotrophs die due to insufficient ATP production.

### Scenario 2: Oxygen Limiting

In this scenario, oxygen and nitrate are limited. As oxygen is depleted, you must evolve anaerobic capabilities to continue generating ATP. You will be forced to evolve anaerobiosis (activity under oxygen-free conditions) to use the alternative electron acceptor iron, then to evolve for fermentation to use sulfur and organic acids, and finally evolve methanogenesis to use CO2 and hydrogen gas. 

	•	Win Condition: Successfully evolve your heterotrophs to survive anaerobically and oxidize all available glucose and cellulose, even as oxygen runs out.
	•	Lose Condition: All heterotrophs die due to insufficient ATP or failure to adapt to anaerobic conditions.
